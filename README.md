1. How to run the app

  The app has all the files needed to run in a single master folder named: "Project GMaps".
  Open from within a browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, the file named index.html which resides in the main folder, "Project GMaps".


2. How to work with the app


In summary this app offers to the user the possibility to find interesting places to visit in a any location in the world. As an example, a user visiting Paris for the first time, has the possibility of receiving suggestions of most proeminent places to visit such as museums, restaurants, castles etc.

Once the index.html is open a menu is displayed on the left showing places to visit for a particular location.

The user can interact with the app, by using the left menu, as follows:
- the user can select any location in the world in order to receive suggestions of places to visit in that  particular location
- the user has the option to restrict the suggested places in a range from the location center (eg.: within 5000 meters from Vienna city center)
- once the user receives a list of suggested places to visit she has the possibility to filter the results by the rating of the places
- the user has the option of selecting the type of location she wants to visit from a predefined menu of types of places (eg: "restaurant", "museum", "castle" etc.)
- by clicking a suggested place image the user can highlight the corresponding marker on the map
- by clicking the place link above the place image to display a pop-up window showing details about the image

The user can see a street view of the places suggested to visit by clicking on the marker for a particular place. Also the user will receive links to Wikipedia articles about the respective place, in case that info is available.
